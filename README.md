GitHub Classroom Project Guidelines 

This document explains how to properly use GitHub Classroom for your projects, the workflow rules, and the policies on AI tool usage. 

Shape 

1. Task Assignment 

Each team must clearly define the responsibilities of each member. 
 

Include a Task Assignment section in your Project Report, listing who is responsible for each feature or subsystem. 

Every team member must write code. 
 

Tasks should be divided so that all members contribute to the coding process. 
 

For example: one member may focus on sensor code, another on communication interfaces, another on control logic, etc. 
 

Collaboration is encouraged, but each student must make meaningful, individual contributions shown through separate commits in GitHub.

2. Initial Design 

Before you begin coding: 

Clone your starter project before starting development. 
 

If a starter project is provided, use it. 
 

If not, create a new project cloned from a working past project, renamed appropriately for your current assignment. 
 

Begin with your design idea first: 
 

Start by outlining the hardware system design. 
 

Then create a top-level software design (modules, functions, interfaces). 
 

Implement one function or feature at a time — avoid uploading the full solution at once.

3. AI Tool Usage Requirements 

If you choose to use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, etc.), you must follow these rules: 

Start with your own design. 
 

Provide your own hardware and software design plan first in your Project Report — before using AI. 
 

Ask AI for advice, not full solutions. 
 

You may ask AI for suggestions, optimizations, or debugging help, but you must not simply request a complete solution. 
 

Keep both versions. 
 

Save both the original design (your own) and the AI-modified design. 
 

Document what changed and why you accepted or rejected AI suggestions in your Project Report. 
 

Maintain individual contribution. 
 

Every team member must still commit their own work and understand the code. 
 

No “one-shot” AI generation. 
 

You may not provide a short project description and ask AI to generate both the hardware and software solution in one step. 
 

The design, implementation, and debugging process must remain student-driven.

4. Feature Development and Commits 

When using GitHub Classroom: 

Each feature or major change must be committed separately. 
 

Each commit message must include: 
 

A short, clear description of what was changed or added. 
 

Which team member made the contribution. 
 

Your GitHub repository should show a step-by-step development process, not just a single final upload. 
 

Do not push the entire finished project at once — commit regularly as you work. 
 

Shape 

5. Explaining Your Solution 

For each major part of the project: 

Provide a clear written explanation of your approach and reasoning in your Project Report. 
 

Include: 
 

Hardware design diagrams and design logic. 
 

Software structure (top-level design and modular breakdown). 
 

Implementation steps, challenges faced, and solutions. 
 

Reflections on what worked, what didn’t, and any AI-assisted modifications (if applicable).

Development Process Summary 

Your team’s development flow should follow this order: 

Clone or create your starter project. 
 

Assign tasks among team members so that everyone codes and records them in the Project Report. 
 

Create the design (hardware + top-level code plan). 
 

(If using AI): Ask for advice and record changes in the Project Report. 
 

Implement features one at a time, committing after each major milestone. 
 

Document all reasoning and progress in the Project Report. 
 

Push all commits to GitHub Classroom before the deadline. 

      8.  Submit a zip file of your solution to Canvas.
